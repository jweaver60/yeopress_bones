# YeoPress Bones
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme -- for YeoPress__

It's Bones, but for YeoPress. An attempt to utilize Grunt and Bower 
for a lightweight and flexible WordPress Theme.

Forked from **Eddie Machado**: http://themble.com/bones

## Some Tweaks:

- Using [Foundation Grid System](http://foundation.zurb.com) instead of default Bones grid.
- Removed Compass config, using Grunt to watch for and compile SCSS.
- Removed LESS.
- Using Bower for dependencies.
